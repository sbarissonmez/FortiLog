# FortiLog

This script receives syslog messages from a FortiGate device and send them to a SQLite database. To view the tableâ€™s contents, you need a SQlite management tool. Download the `fortilog.py` file to your local machine then run the script from the command line.
Configure the Fortigate to send syslog messages to the IP address or your local machine.
